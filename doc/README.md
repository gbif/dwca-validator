#Occurrence Data Validation Services

##High-level issues

  •	[http://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/](http://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/) doesn’t expose information about data interpretation issues that later can appear while indexing a file in the GBIF portal; which is mainly caused due that this tool doesn’t make use of the validation libraries used during data interpretation.
  
  •	Data publishers cannot validate their occurrence data before its submission to GBIF, which leads to use the GBIF portal as an indexing and data-cleaning platform.
  
  •	GBIF doesn’t provide a service to validate generic occurrence data in a different format to DwC-A.
